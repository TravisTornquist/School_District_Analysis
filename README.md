# School_District_Analysis
(Excerpt from Student_Data_Challenge.ipynb)

The analysis above offers some limited insight into the schools in this data set.

When grouping students by school type and grade, mean math scores were generally higher at charter schools than in public schools. One exception to this finding is in 12th grade, where public schools have a higher mean math score.

This difference in score is in spite of the average funding for a charter school being about $40,000 less than the average funding for public schools.

It would be beneficial to perform an analysis on the average reading scores by school type and by grade. If the trends in reading scores are the same as for math scores between public and charter schools it may be helpful to explore potential reasons for the disparity. Understanding this difference could help public schools to raise their average scores
